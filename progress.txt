# Ralph Progress Log
# Project: Qwen3-VL-Interactive-Showcase
# Branch: ralph/qwen3-vl-showcase
# Started: 2026-01-19

## Codebase Patterns
- Use Tailwind CSS v4 with `@import "tailwindcss";` in CSS files (not @tailwind directives)
- Tailwind is configured via `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin, no tailwind.config.js needed
- Run `npm run typecheck` to verify TypeScript types
- Run `npm run lint` to run ESLint
- Run `npm run build` to build for production
- Components go in `src/components/` with named exports
- The dev-browser skill is unavailable; use `npm run build` to verify app works

## 2026-01-20 - US-001
- **What was implemented:** Project scaffolding with React + TypeScript
  - Created Vite React + TypeScript project
  - Installed and configured Tailwind CSS v4 with Vite plugin
  - Set up folder structure (src/components, src/pages, src/utils)
  - Added ESLint configuration with React hooks and TypeScript support
  - Added Prettier configuration for code formatting
- **Files changed:**
  - package.json, package-lock.json - project dependencies
  - vite.config.ts - Vite configuration with Tailwind plugin
  - tsconfig.json, tsconfig.app.json, tsconfig.node.json - TypeScript config
  - eslint.config.js - ESLint configuration
  - .prettierrc - Prettier configuration
  - .gitignore - Git ignore patterns
  - index.html - HTML entry point
  - src/index.css - Tailwind CSS import
  - src/main.tsx - React entry point
  - src/App.tsx - Main app component
  - src/components/.gitkeep, src/pages/.gitkeep, src/utils/.gitkeep - folder structure
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Tailwind CSS v4 uses `@import "tailwindcss";` instead of `@tailwind` directives
  - Use `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin for Vite integration (no separate tailwind.config.js needed)
  - Vite creates project with eslint.config.js flat config format

## 2026-01-20 - US-002
- **What was implemented:** App layout shell with header and main content area
  - Created Header component with app title 'Qwen3-VL Showcase' and mobile menu toggle
  - Created Sidebar component placeholder for session history with responsive behavior
  - Created MainLayout component combining header, sidebar, and main content area
  - Updated App.tsx to use the new layout components
  - Removed unused App.css (using Tailwind CSS only)
- **Files changed:**
  - src/components/Header.tsx - new header component with responsive design
  - src/components/Sidebar.tsx - new sidebar placeholder component
  - src/components/MainLayout.tsx - new layout wrapper component
  - src/App.tsx - updated to use MainLayout
  - src/App.css - deleted (unused)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Components are in src/components/ directory
  - Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:) for breakpoints
  - Mobile-first approach with sidebar hidden by default on small screens
  - The dev-browser skill is not available in this environment; use `npm run build` to verify

## 2026-01-20 - US-003
- **What was implemented:** Welcome and overview section
  - Created WelcomeSection component with gradient hero styling, model name, and description
  - Created CapabilitiesSection component with 4 capabilities (visual reasoning, Q&A, instruction following, OCR)
  - Created UseCasesSection component with 4 common use cases and example prompts
  - Updated App.tsx to compose all sections together
- **Files changed:**
  - src/components/WelcomeSection.tsx - new hero component with gradient styling
  - src/components/CapabilitiesSection.tsx - capabilities grid with icons and descriptions
  - src/components/UseCasesSection.tsx - use cases list with example prompts
  - src/App.tsx - updated to use new section components
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use consistent spacing with Tailwind's `space-y-6` for vertical sections
  - Use `role="img"` and `aria-label` for emoji icons for accessibility
  - Card hover states work well with `hover:border-*` and `hover:bg-*` combinations

## 2026-01-20 - US-004
- **What was implemented:** Text prompt input component
  - Created TextPromptInput component with textarea for entering prompts
  - Added submit button with disabled state when input is empty or over limit
  - Character count display showing current/max characters
  - Max length validation with visual feedback (red border when over limit)
  - Ctrl+Enter keyboard shortcut for quick submission
  - Proper accessibility with aria-label and aria-describedby attributes
  - Integrated component into App.tsx with handlePromptSubmit callback
- **Files changed:**
  - src/components/TextPromptInput.tsx - new component with textarea, submit button, character count
  - src/App.tsx - added TextPromptInput with onSubmit handler
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `aria-describedby` to link character count to textarea for screen readers
  - Conditional styling with template literals works well for validation states
  - Consider keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter) for form submission in text-heavy inputs

## 2026-01-20 - US-005
- **What was implemented:** Image upload via file picker
  - Created ImageUpload component with file input accepting JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP
  - Drag and drop zone with visual feedback when dragging
  - Preview thumbnail displaying uploaded image with max-height constraint
  - Clear/remove button with both an X button on the thumbnail and a text button below
  - File size validation (10MB max) with error messages
  - File type validation with user-friendly error messages
  - Keyboard accessibility with Enter/Space support on the drop zone
  - Integrated component into App.tsx with handleImageChange callback
- **Files changed:**
  - src/components/ImageUpload.tsx - new component with file picker, drag-and-drop, preview, validation
  - src/App.tsx - added ImageUpload with onImageChange handler
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `URL.createObjectURL()` for creating preview URLs and `URL.revokeObjectURL()` for cleanup
  - Drag and drop requires handling dragEnter, dragLeave, dragOver, and drop events
  - Reset file input by setting `.value = ""` when clearing
  - Use role="button" and tabIndex for keyboard accessibility on non-button elements
