# Ralph Progress Log
# Project: Qwen3-VL-Interactive-Showcase
# Branch: ralph/qwen3-vl-showcase
# Started: 2026-01-19

## Codebase Patterns
- Use Tailwind CSS v4 with `@import "tailwindcss";` in CSS files (not @tailwind directives)
- Tailwind is configured via `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin, no tailwind.config.js needed
- Run `npm run typecheck` to verify TypeScript types
- Run `npm run lint` to run ESLint
- Run `npm run build` to build for production
- Components go in `src/components/` with named exports
- The dev-browser skill is unavailable; use `npm run build` to verify app works
- API serverless functions go in `api/` folder with Vercel-style handler exports
- Frontend API utilities are in `src/utils/api.ts` - use `generateCompletion()` to call the API
- ESLint react-refresh: separate context definition (.ts), provider component (.tsx), and hooks into different files
- Types/interfaces go in `src/types/` folder, hooks go in `src/hooks/` folder
- Session state: use useSession() hook from `src/hooks/useSession.ts`

## 2026-01-20 - US-001
- **What was implemented:** Project scaffolding with React + TypeScript
  - Created Vite React + TypeScript project
  - Installed and configured Tailwind CSS v4 with Vite plugin
  - Set up folder structure (src/components, src/pages, src/utils)
  - Added ESLint configuration with React hooks and TypeScript support
  - Added Prettier configuration for code formatting
- **Files changed:**
  - package.json, package-lock.json - project dependencies
  - vite.config.ts - Vite configuration with Tailwind plugin
  - tsconfig.json, tsconfig.app.json, tsconfig.node.json - TypeScript config
  - eslint.config.js - ESLint configuration
  - .prettierrc - Prettier configuration
  - .gitignore - Git ignore patterns
  - index.html - HTML entry point
  - src/index.css - Tailwind CSS import
  - src/main.tsx - React entry point
  - src/App.tsx - Main app component
  - src/components/.gitkeep, src/pages/.gitkeep, src/utils/.gitkeep - folder structure
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Tailwind CSS v4 uses `@import "tailwindcss";` instead of `@tailwind` directives
  - Use `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin for Vite integration (no separate tailwind.config.js needed)
  - Vite creates project with eslint.config.js flat config format

## 2026-01-20 - US-002
- **What was implemented:** App layout shell with header and main content area
  - Created Header component with app title 'Qwen3-VL Showcase' and mobile menu toggle
  - Created Sidebar component placeholder for session history with responsive behavior
  - Created MainLayout component combining header, sidebar, and main content area
  - Updated App.tsx to use the new layout components
  - Removed unused App.css (using Tailwind CSS only)
- **Files changed:**
  - src/components/Header.tsx - new header component with responsive design
  - src/components/Sidebar.tsx - new sidebar placeholder component
  - src/components/MainLayout.tsx - new layout wrapper component
  - src/App.tsx - updated to use MainLayout
  - src/App.css - deleted (unused)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Components are in src/components/ directory
  - Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:) for breakpoints
  - Mobile-first approach with sidebar hidden by default on small screens
  - The dev-browser skill is not available in this environment; use `npm run build` to verify

  - Separate context definition (createContext) into its own .ts file, provider component into .tsx, and hook into hooks folder
  - Use crypto.randomUUID() for generating unique IDs client-side
  - State persistence in React context is sufficient for session-scoped data (no localStorage needed)

  - Added ConversationTurn type in src/types/session.ts for tracking individual turns
  - Updated HistoryExchange to include conversationHistory array
  - Extended session context with addFollowUpToExchange function
  - Updated API (api/generate.ts) to accept and process conversationHistory for context continuity

## 2026-01-20 - US-013
- **What was implemented:** Editable prompt history
  - Added edit button (pencil icon) to HistoryItem component
  - Edit handler passed through Sidebar to MainLayout to App.tsx
  - Clicking edit populates prompt input with previous prompt text
  - If exchange had a URL image (not blob), restores it in ImageInput
  - Resubmitting creates a new exchange (existing addExchange flow)
  - ImageInput now supports initialUrl prop with key-based remount for resetting state
- **Files changed:**
  - src/components/HistoryItem.tsx - added onEdit prop and edit button with pencil icon
  - src/components/Sidebar.tsx - added onEditExchange prop and handler

  - src/App.tsx - added handleEditExchange, imageInputKey, imageInputInitialUrl for edit flow
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use key prop to force component remount when you need to reset internal state
  - ESLint react-hooks/set-state-in-effect forbids setState in effects; use initial state values instead
  - ESLint react-hooks/refs forbids accessing refs during render; avoid refs for state tracking
  - Blob URLs are temporary and won't survive component remounts; only restore URL-based images
