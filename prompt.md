Your job is to create an interactive webapp that shows the complete capabilities of the Qwen3 VL 8B Instruct model (https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct). 
You can see the specification documents under specs/.
Use tasks/prd.json to track tasks and log progress.
Write tests for each feature as you go and add a sentence about why it exists and why it's important to progress.txt.
Make a commit and push your changes after every single file edit.
As you go along, you may discover bugs or come up with ideas for new features. In this case, add new tasks to tasks/prd.json. You may also modify the original PRD document as you make progress, if it makes sense.
After implementing new functionality, or resolving problems, run the tests for that unit of code that was improved.
